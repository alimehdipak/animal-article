<p>Every mother’s instinct is to protect her children, whether human or animal and what this cat did in New South Wales, Australia, is an excellent example of what a mother can do to save her creatures.<br />
A passerby noticed a family of cats by the side of the road, consisting of a mother and her three kittens.</p>
<p>He immediately contacted CatRescue 901, a Terrey Hills-based rescue organization. When the rescuers came, the cat approached them and brought them to her three babies. She was skin and bones, and she had plainly done everything she could to feed and protect her animals.</p>
<p>The four cats needed medical care, and when they arrived at the shelter, it was obvious they were starving. Upon assessing their condition, the vets realized that the three kittens had eyelid agenesis, a congenital condition that caused them to have no eyelids, and would have led them to blindness if they didn’t receive proper treatment.</p>
<p>They were fed and bathed, and allowed to rest on comfortable beds. Medication was also administered and the feline mom, Elodie, was faring better, especially after being spayed.</p>
<p>Jenny, the founder of the rescue group, stated that they were in the right location at the right moment. “Not many people could afford eye agenesis surgery since it’s so costly,” she explained. The path to recovery is still ahead of them, but what matters is that their mother, Elodie, is certain that they are in excellent hands.</p>
<p><strong>This is Elodie, a feline mom who tried her best to keep her kittens fed and safe, but was clearly struggling to go on.</strong></p>

<p>It may seem like these little pups have been getting themselves into trouble, but that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In fact, these pups simply couldn’t be any more innocent. Or at least that’s what they are trying to make you believe.</p>
<p>Check out the pictures below and you’ll see that they couldn’t possibly be responsible for all this mess.</p>
<h3>1. No, I don’t know what happened to your cookies.</h3>

<p>As we all know, most of the times you don’t actually get to choose your cat, but the cat actually chooses you, and that’s exactly what happened to cyclist Madison Kelly when she finished a bike race held in South Chicago, and she came across a stray kitten found by other cyclists under a car.<br />
The group of racers went roaming around, looking for anyone interested in giving the poor kitty a home. Being the cat person that she is, Kelly came up to the group to take a closer look. While she was holding the little kitten, she decided to climb up on her shoulder, and that marked the moment the cat chose Madison to be her forever mom. Madison decided to name her Puig, which means podium in Latin, and climb in Catalan.<br />
Madison might have not won the race, but she sure got something more valuable to take home with her. Check out how destiny played its part in the story of Madison and Puig by scrolling through the following photos, and don’t forget to drop by Madison’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/madison_m_kelly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> account to keep up with their daily life.<br />

<p>A video of an adorable dog smiling and wagging her tail after being saved from the streets went viral. The dog’s name is Layla and she was rescued by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beaumontanimalcare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beaumont Animal Care</a> after she was seen wandering the streets alone for several days. Rachel Barron, a person of the Animal Care’s staff, visited the dog in her kennel and started talking to her. When she talked in a baby-like voice, the dog was so amused she even smiled. It was probably the first time the little dog got some attention and care from a human. Layla grinned and wagged her pretty, little tail, in sign of appreciation of Rachel’s cute gestures. Luckily, she was able to capture the heartwarming moment in her video camera and it went instantly viral.<br />
Needless to say, after the video was posted they received a lot of adoption inquiries for Layla, and a local couple was chosen to be Layla’s new family.<br />
Once they brought her home, Layla quickly got used to her new home and immediately got along with the other dogs of her new family.</p>

<p>Toro is a five-year-old pup with a painful past.</p>
<p>Toro, alongside two other pups, was rescued and brought to a shelter after he was found chained to a fence outside an abandoned house.</p>
<p>The poor pup was weighed down by the nearly 16-pound-heavy chain and it is believed that he’s spent his entire life outside.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4442" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-11-300x297-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="297" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-11-300x297-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-11-300x297-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>After Toro and his co-prisoners were unchained and removed from the abandoned house, they were brought to the <a href="https://hempsteadny.gov/animal-shelter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Town of Hempstead Animal Shelter</a> where they received the attention and care they needed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4432" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-03-300x298-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="298" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-03-300x298-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-03-300x298-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toro was initially very shy and scared and didn’t necessarily seem to understand that he was finally safe.</p>
<p>It looked like all those years of neglect had perhaps broken the little pup’s spirit.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4437" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-08-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></p>
<p>After having been so betrayed and mistreated by humans in the past, it would have been understandable if Toro never trusted another human being ever again.</p>
<p>But as it turns out, that’s not how Toro intends to live his life.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4435" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-06-300x300-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-06-300x300-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-06-300x300-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Slowly, Toro began warming up and trusting his new surroundings more and more, and it became clear that the little pup has a big and affectionate heart.</p>
<p>Though it takes him a while to get comfortable around new people, it is more than obvious that the little guy just wants to love and be loved.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4438" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-09-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></p>
<p>One day, after having grown successfully more comfortable around the people at the shelter, Toro decided to show his love for his rescuers in the most adorable way.</p>
<p>Toro was out in the yard playing around when he suddenly approached staff member Melissa Fogarty.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4433" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-04-300x300-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-04-300x300-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-04-300x300-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To her surprise, the pup snuggled up in her lap and pressed himself against her chest in a heartfelt hug.</p>
<p>This turned out of to be the first hug of many, as Toro soon began hugging everyone he considered a friend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-4434" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-05-300x300-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-05-300x300-1.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-05-300x300-1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Now, Toro is known around the shelter for his sweet hugs and everyone loves him dearly.</p>
<p>Toro can still get a little bit shy and nervous and isn’t always super comfortable with the hustle and bustle that living at a shelter sometimes entails, but he loves and trusts everyone working there</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4441" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-10-268x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="300" /></p>
<p>Everyone is rooting for sweet little Toro to find his perfect forever home, but he’s already spent a year at the shelter without finding a family that’s ready to give him the love and patience he needs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4436" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-07-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></p>
<p>Toro briefly moved in with a potential family this last January but was returned to the shelter after less than two weeks.</p>
<p>Due to his past trauma, the sweet boy needs a family that’s ready to provide him with a lot of love, structure, training and patience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4431" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dog-chained-to-abandoned-house-gets-rescued-and-now-loves-to-hug-everyone-he-meets-02-240x300-1.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></p>
<p>For the right family, Toro is sure to bring so much love, joy and hugs into their lives.</p>
<p>He’s an incredibly affectionate pup and truly deserves a warm and loving home.</p>

<p>Beaux Tox is a Labrador Retriever unique in his look. He has a wrinkled forehead that makes him look like he’s perpetually concerned about something, and he was neglected by many just because of this flaw. His condition was caused by being squashed in his mother’s womb while sharing space with five other siblings. Apart from this peculiar characteristic, Beaux is just like any other dog, and his head deformity didn’t affect his intelligence or life expectancy, as an MRI confirmed. He definitely has so much to offer, if only people gave him a chance.<br />
When he was a puppy his breeders gave him away for free, because they weren’t able to sell him, and the man who adopted him confined Beaux in the backyard after he found out the dog didn’t get along with his cats. During the 5 years with that man, who left him in a very malnourished state. During that time, the man tried to get rid of Beaux, and local rescue groups tried to find him a forever home, but he was given up again and again, always being returned to the man’s backyard.<br />
Thankfully, things didn’t stay that way for Beaux because Jamie Hulit was sent from above to give Beaux another chance. Jamie knew what it was like to be in foster care as she once went through it when she was 9 years old. That’s why she decided to adopt Beaux, and with the help of Dr. Jay Rydberg, Beaux was back in shape. Take a look at Beaux’s story below and follow him on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/beauxtoxrescues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Instagram</a> to keep up with his new life.<br />

<p>Animals live to hunt or be hunted, kill or be killed. They can fend off for themselves, find food and shelter, and adapt spectacularly to any given situation or environment they might find themselves in. More so with strays. Stray cats and dogs are toughened up by the streets and usually survive for a long time. However, injuries caused by accidents or abuse can greatly hinder the life of a stray in the mean streets of our big cities. This is what happened to Pooh, who was found gravely injured in the streets of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Thankfully, Pooh was given the care he needed and now has a new lease on life.</p>

<h3>It was unclear how Pooh got injured, but the kind woman who found him brought him to a clinic and a surgeon named Vladislav Zlatinov</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/meet-pooh-the-rescue-cat-who-just-got-brand-new-legs-and-nobody-is-going-to-stop-him-now-02-300x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<h3>Having examined Pooh, Dr. Zlatinov found that Pooh needed to be amputated.</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4301" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/meet-pooh-the-rescue-cat-who-just-got-brand-new-legs-and-nobody-is-going-to-stop-him-now-03-300x280-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="280" /></p>
<h3>The complications of this procedure could cause Pooh to be euthanized. Not wanting that to happen, the surgeon had a brilliant idea.</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4302" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/meet-pooh-the-rescue-cat-who-just-got-brand-new-legs-and-nobody-is-going-to-stop-him-now-04-300x199-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<h3>He fitted Pooh with prosthetics: “I had the vague idea that this is done sometimes, but it sounded impossible for our practice,” Zlatinov said. “But I wanted to try.”</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4303" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/meet-pooh-the-rescue-cat-who-just-got-brand-new-legs-and-nobody-is-going-to-stop-him-now-05-300x268-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="268" /></p>
<h3>Now Pooh has adjusted well to his new limbs, thanks to Dr. Zlatinov.</h3>

<h3>“Pooh can move freely on flat surfaces, walking, running, even making small jumps. What’s important is that he doesn’t seem to be in pain.”</h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4305" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/meet-pooh-the-rescue-cat-who-just-got-brand-new-legs-and-nobody-is-going-to-stop-him-now-07-300x209-1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209" /></p>
<h3>Pooh’s story gives hope to so many injured animals.</h3>

<h3>Pooh is now in “Let’s Adopt”, a shelter in Bulgaria, recovering from his injuries and waiting for his new family to come find him.</h3>

<p dir="ltr"><b>“I’ve never had a stray dog warm up to me like this. She was just waiting for someone to give her a chance.”</b></p>
<p dir="ltr">Stray dogs are usually sad and scared and that they retreat when humans try to touch them, to realize their trust it takes a while . It’s always said that cats choose their owners, but today’s story shows that dogs choose the owners also.</p>

<p dir="ltr">On a Friday night, while a lady named Jillian was taking the trash out, she noticed an animal that was hiding behind a bush, the animal was a sweet dog that was confused and scared. She wanted to run towards the animal but which may have scared the poor canine, so she began to approach him carefully, but the instant the dog feel someone getting near him he started running. Jillian wanted to point out the dog that she isn’t getting to hurt him, so she began to make a conversation and surprisingly the dog stood there listening to her before it ran and disappeared. The woman spotted the dog again the subsequent day, but this point it looks as if the animal knew the lady was there to assist him.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4281" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/A2-20-300x205-1.png" alt="" width="300" height="205" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Wanting to meet up with to the dog, Jillian came up with an idea, it worked perfectly since it involved food. “When I rotated to go back inside, I noticed she was following me at a distance,” Jillian told The Dodo. “That was once I figured I could get her to trust me. I got a bowl of water and a few pet food and left them within the corner of my yard before walking a secure distance away.” The dog ate all the food and began following Jillian while keeping a secure distance. The kind woman didn’t know needless to say if the dog is going to be there subsequent day but just in case he did, her husband and she or he knew what to try to in order that they can all become friends. “We got some more pet food and left a trail for her to follow back to our yard, where I fed her again,” she said. “This time, I sat on the brink of the food. I expected her to run away after she ate, but instead she stayed next to me and even started sniffing me!”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4280" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/A3-13-289x300-1.png" alt="" width="289" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">“When I got up, she followed me all the way into my backyard and sat next to me,” Jillian added. “I’ve never had a stray dog warm up to me like this. She was just expecting someone to offer her an opportunity .” The final encounter made Jillian 100% sure that she wanted the dog to become a part of her family, they named her Luna and now she is a crucial member of the family. “We decided to stay here because we are softies who can’t say no,” she said. “I’ve also always loved pit bull mixes so I fell crazy with Luna directly .” Looks like Luna loved her new family also and likes to learn how to be more socialized with humans. “Luna seems to be really smart,” Jillian said. “She learned her name in at some point and is already responding to some basic commands, albeit it had been clear that no-one had taught them to her before.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4277" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/A4-7-250x300-1.png" alt="" width="250" height="300" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Luna is that the neatest thing that happened to this family they’re now sure that, they desire the dog has been a part of their lives forever. “She’s still a touch scared, especially of loud noises like doors closing, but she is that the sweetest,” Jillian said. “She likes to frolic with us within the backyard and to snuggle up and provides us kisses once we sit down.” We hope the story of sweet Luna will inspire more people to adopt pets and provides them forever homes.
